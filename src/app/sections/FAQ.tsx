    answer: (
      <>
        Great question! A hackathon is an event where student hackers bring
        their passion for technology to create a new project coded from
        scratch. It's a chance to collaborate and create something unique —
        an app, a robot, or a website. You'll learn something new in a
        high-energy, engaging environment! At RevolutionUC, participants are
        provided with opportunities to grow while building something they're
        proud of.
